This is a simple plugin that allows you to insert the Google Tag Manager container into your site.

== Description ==

Rather than manually inserting the scary code that Google Tag Manager provides, this plugin does it properly and puts it into the page in the correct Wordpress manner, and in the way that GTM expects.

Of course, you'll still need to put your tags and pixels into the container, via the GTM interface. You can use Tag Assistant(Chrome plugin) to check that everything looks how it should.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-tagman` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Navigate to wp-admin/plugins.php on your site (your WP plugin page)
3. Alternatively, upload `wp-tagman.zip` via the upload plugin section at wp-admin/plugins.php
4. Activate this plugin. 
5. etc...

OR you can just install it with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and typing WP TagMan
